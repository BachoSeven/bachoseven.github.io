# About Me

Hi! I'm an undergraduate math student at the university of Pisa, currently interested in:

- **Algebraic/Arithmetic Geometry**
- **Commutative Algebra**
- **Category Theory**
- **Model Theory**

You can find some learning material I've written for myself over the years in the [maths](maths) section of this webpage.

I am also passionate about [Linux](linux) and open-source software, and I'm one of the members of PHC, a group of students who administrate a server for students' personal webpages (such as this one), and do tech projects of various kinds. Find more about it [here](http://betti.dm.unipi.it/servizi/PHC.html).
