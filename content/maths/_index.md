__In these days the angel of topology and the devil of abstract algebra fight for the soul of each individual mathematical domain__
~ Hermann Weyl, 1939

# General resources

- LibGen (pdfs of any math book): if you use `8.8.8.8` as your DNS, [this](https://libgen.rs) mirror should work
- [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com): you probably already know this, but there's a [self-hosted](https://tex.dm.unipi.it/) version of the most popular online LaTeX editor in the
  math department's servers.

# Courses

Here's some material from my undergrad classes, drop me an email for any glaring mistakes.

## Istituzioni di Algebra

The PDFs and LaTeX sources of all the [exercises](https://github.com/BachoSeven/esercizi-istalg) from the course, on commutative and homological algebra.

## Logic

In 2023 I TeX'ed up some [exercises](https://github.com/BachoSeven/esercizi-logica) from Di Nasso's Mathematical Logic course.

## ETI (Set Theory)

A [repository](https://github.com/BachoSeven/eti) for the course of _Elementi di Teoria degli Insiemi_ held by Marcello Mamino in 2022, containing:

- a simple list of theorems, inspired from
[baldo](https://poisson.phc.dm.unipi.it/~baldino)'s lists.
- a simple proof of KÃ¶nig's theorem.

## ASD

Snippets of code, course notes and the final project from the _Algorithms and Data Structure_ course of Roberto Grossi: [repository](https://github.com/BachoSeven/asd).

## Algebra 2

A markdown [list](orali-alg2) of past oral exam questions.

## Geometria 2

Idem as above, a [list](orali-g2) of oral exam questions.

## Ricerca Operativa

Same but "with potatoes": [list](orali-ro).

## Laboratorio Didattico di Matematica Computazionale

Some **MATLAB** [exercises](https://github.com/BachoSeven/labdidcomp) from the aforementioned course.

## LPL (Principles for Software Composition)

[This](https://git.phc.dm.unipi.it/BachoSeven/labLPL) is a repository containing some exercises I coded during "Linguaggi di Programmazione con Laboratorio" classes.
