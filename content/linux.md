title: "Linux is not Unix"
---

I am an avid user of Linux (specifically Arch Linux), and you can find my _dotfiles_ detailing the programs I use [here](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dotfiles).

If you are a student from Pisa, you can find me hanging out with the servers in PHC, aula 106 of the math department, were we play with various Linux distributions and fix software problems
as an hobby.

## Scripts

In PHC we maintain a repository containing scripts for the average math department enjoyer:

- [printa4](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin/scripts/printa4) lets you print remotely from aula 4 (or any other printer) from your own computer, by opening Okular remotely in a graphical session.
- [impagina](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin/scripts/impagina) changes the layout of a PDF in order to print it as a booklet.
- [gobbino](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin/scripts/gobbino) is a magical script for downloading any video or pdf from all of Massimo Gobbino's courses.

## Articles

I sometimes write tech articles for [MoreThanTech](https://morethantech.it/):
